# Unhandled Database Query Error in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where database query failures in route handlers are not properly handled.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a robust solution. The issue stems from the lack of comprehensive error handling for database queries.

## Problem

The original code lacks error handling for the case where a database query to fetch user data might fail or return null, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Solution

The improved code (`bugSolution.js`) includes robust error handling using `try...catch` blocks to catch database query errors.  It also uses more descriptive error messages for better client-side debugging.
